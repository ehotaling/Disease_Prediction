 Next Steps

    Refactor CLI to Support Model Choice

        Add selection menu

        Load correct model (joblib or torch)

        Predict, return disease, and treatment

    Persist All Models

        Save logistic model (lr_model.pkl)

        Save MLP weights (mlp_model.pth)

        Implement loader for PyTorch inference

    Expand Feature Selection

        Add mutual info and RFE

        Create merged ranking table

        Highlight overlap between methods

    Improve Model Training

        Use cross-validation

        Tune hyperparameters

        Compare tuned vs. untuned model performance

    Enhance Evaluation

        Confusion matrices

        ROC curves (macro-avg if needed)

        Top-k predictions (top-3 accuracy)

        Per-class analysis: where do each model struggle?

    Final Presentation

        Walk through motivation, methods, improvements

        Add visuals, performance comparisons, and architecture

        Show CLI demo options and results
