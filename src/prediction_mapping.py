# File: prediction_mapping.py
# Purpose: Map predicted disease labels to corresponding treatments.
#          This uses fuzzy matching with RapidFuzz so that if the
#          disease name isnâ€™t an exact match, we can still find the
#          closest treatment.

# Build a mapping from disease names to treatments

# Define a fuzzy matching function to retrieve treatment recommendations
